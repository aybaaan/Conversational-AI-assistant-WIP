Welcome to the Conversational AI Assistant repository, a work-in-progress project developed in Python. This repository aims to provide an interactive and intelligent conversational assistant powered by various libraries and technologies.

Features

•Text-to-Speech Conversion: With the pyttsx3 library, the assistant can synthesize natural-sounding speech from text, allowing it to respond audibly to user queries and instructions.
•Interactive Queries: Powered by the pywhatkit library, the assistant can search the web, fetch relevant information, play music, and perform a wide range of actions based on user input.
•Date and Time: The assistant incorporates the datetime library to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the current date and time, allowing users to inquire about schedules and deadlines.
•Wikipedia Integration: Leveraging the wikipedia library, the assistant can fetch summaries, information, and details from Wikipedia, offering valuable insights and knowledge on a vast array of topics.
•Humor and Entertainment: Thanks to the pyjokes library, the assistant is equipped with a collection of witty and humorous jokes, adding a touch of levity and amusement to conversations.
